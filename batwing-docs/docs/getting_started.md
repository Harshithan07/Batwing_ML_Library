# Getting Started

Welcome to **Batwing ML** — a lightweight, functional, and visual machine learning library built to simplify core ML workflows without sacrificing flexibility.

## Why Batwing ML?

Traditional ML libraries like scikit-learn offer excellent building blocks, but often require boilerplate, manual tracking, and repetitive logic. Batwing ML bridges that gap by offering:

- Modular functions for classification, regression, and EDA
- Built-in support for cross-validation, model comparison, and tuning
- Visual diagnostics (ROC, lift charts, importance plots) built-in
- Designed for **real-world data workflows**, **not just toy examples**
- Easy integration into Jupyter notebooks, pipelines, and dashboards

Whether you’re a student, data scientist, or ML engineer — Batwing ML helps you go from raw data to insights faster.
