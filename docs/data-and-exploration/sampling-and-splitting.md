# Sampling & Splitting

Helpers for sampling your dataset and creating reproducible train/test (and optional validation) splits.

Use this when you want to:

* Subsample large datasets for faster iteration
* Create consistent train/test splits with clear parameters
* Avoid copy-pasted split logic across notebooks

```python
from batwing_ml import prepare_sample_split
```
